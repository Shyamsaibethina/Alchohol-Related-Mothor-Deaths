## Context:

As someone who recently started driving, the first question that pops up for a new driver is "Am I doing anything wrong?" As countless driving courses for teens and beginner drivers preach, Do Not Drink and Drive. These lessons may be effective for some time, but are they still in the driver's mind after a couple of years?

## Goal:

The goal is to find out if people who are older get into more crashes because of Alcohol, or we still need to solely educated novice drivers about drinking and driving. Are teens the only age group where they are vulnerable to drink and drive, or are other groups more vulnerable? This project aims to answer that question.
