These lessons may be effective for some time, but are they still in the driver’s mind after a couple of years?\nGoal:\nThe goal is to find out if people who are older get into more crashes because of Alcohol, or we still need to solely educated novice drivers about drinking and driving. Are teens the only age group where they are vulnerable to drink and drive, or are other groups more vulnerable? This project aims to answer that question.\n\n\n\n",

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\nsummary(cars)\n##      speed           dist       \n##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00\n\n\nIncluding Plots\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// add bootstrap table styles to pandoc tables\nfunction bootstrapStylePandocTables() {\n  $('tr.odd').parent('tbody').parent('table').addClass('table table-condensed');\n}\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  bootstrapStylePandocTables();\n});\n\n\n\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  window.buildTabsets(\"TOC\");\n});\n\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  $('.tabset-dropdown > .nav-tabs > li').click(function () {\n    $(this).parent().toggleClass('nav-tabs-open');\n  });\n});\n\n  (function () {\n    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n    script.src  = \"https://mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\";\n    document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script);\n  })();\n",
