But the second graph shows that a high percentage of both 21-29 and 30+ age groups of the total deaths are because of alcohol. The highest peak is at the 21-29 age group, and this the legal age allowed to drink in most states. This means that Drinking and Driving is not prevelant in the minds of people who are older than 20 compared to 16-20 year olds.\nAbout:\nThanks for reading about my project! My name is Shyam Sai Bethina and I will be a senior at Dublin Coffman High School this fall. My passion is computer science, specifically Artificial Intelligence, and I enjoyed researching about this project. I love learning new languages, and I had a lot of fun learning about R and implementing it in this project!\nContact me:\nshyamsaibethina@gmail.com\n614-500-1858\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis graph shows that total number of deaths from the years 1982 to 2019. The graph shows the total deaths for the ages 16,18,21 and 30 and above. Each graph also shows how much of the total deaths are caused by having a blood alchohol concentration(BAC) of 0.08 percent or higher, otherwise known as drinking and driving.\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look at the percentages, as age increases, the percentage of alcohol related deaths increase, then decrease. But the overall trend is positive, which means that alcohol is a more prevalent cause in vehicle deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These lessons may be effective for some time, but do they deteriote in effectiveness over time?\nGoal:\nYoung drivers’ crash risk is substantially higher than adults when they drive after drinking alcohol, but are less likely than adults to consumer alcohol and drive.1 The goal is to find out if people who are older get into more crashes because of Alcohol, and if we still need to only educate novice drivers about drinking and driving. Are teens the only age group where they are vulnerable to drink and drive, or are other groups more vulnerable? This project aims to answer that question.\n\nVoas, R.B.; Torres, P.; Romano, E.; and Lacey, J.H. 2012. Alcohol-related risk of driver fatalities: an update using 2007 data.
